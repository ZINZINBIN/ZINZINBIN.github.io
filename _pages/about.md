Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jinsu Kim, a Ph.D graduate student in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton. My research interests are in data-driven modeling and control for nonlinear dynamics. My main research topics are on nuclear fusion plasma, researching the effect of RMP on electron heat transport and physics-informed data-driven modeling for zeroth order plasma dynamics and control. Now, I am working on modeling dynamic systems, control theory and reduced models combined with machine learning. I shared several computational works on <a href = "https://github.com/zinzinbin">Github</a>. Please see and share your opinions.
